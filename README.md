# Zen Browser Custom UI

This is my personal **userChrome.css** setup for the Zen Browser. It’s a collection of all the visual tweaks and layout adjustments I’ve made to get a cleaner, more compact look that still feels smooth and modern.

I changed how the titlebar, navbar, and toolbar behave — mainly focusing on reducing clutter, improving spacing, and keeping the interface transparent and minimal. There are also tweaks to transitions, hover effects, and some layout rearrangements to make things feel tighter and more natural overall.


## Notes

- Made and tested on Zen Browser.  
- Feel free to edit or build on top of it — it’s meant to be flexible :)
